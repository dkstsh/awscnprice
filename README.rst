A Python library for working with the `AWS (China) Price List API <http:://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/billing-and-payment.html>`_.

Features:

* Simple boto3-like interface
* Service-specific helpers (only EC2 and RDS thus far)
* Local caching support

This library is modified based on https://github.com/lyft/awspricing.
